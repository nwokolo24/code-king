            <p>Visual hierarchy helps me direct you to what I feel is
                most important in my webpage. Your time and attention as a user
                of my website is very important to me, and I don't want to
                lose them, so I use visual hierarchy to direct you to where
                I want you looking at.

            <p>
                Proximity in web design is the grouping and shaping of
                objects in a composition. Proximity creates connection
                between visual elements in a composition. It can also be
                 used to show contrast between elements in a web page.

            <p>
                In web design, white space or empty space is where
                nothing is happening. White space if executed with
                skills can create a feeling of satisfaction to a user
                of a website. White space are not necessarily white.
