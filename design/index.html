        <p>Visual hierarchy helps me direct you to what I feel is
            most important in my webpage. Your time and attention as a user
            of my website is very important to me, and I don't want to
            lose them, so I use visual hierarchy to direct you to where
            I want you looking at.

            Proximity in webpage

        <p>
            In web design, white space or empty space is where
             nothing is happening. White space if executed with 
             skills can create a feeling of satisfaction to a user
             of a website. White space are not necessarily white.
