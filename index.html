            <h2>Mr. W</h2>
            <p>I am a student of BYU Idaho majoring in Computer Information Technology with a dream of working with
                Google in the West African Region as the Chief Technology Officer.
                I have love for music and have interest in watching Opera performances. I love driving cars. I am not
                married but am searching for a nice girl to make my wife.</p>
            <p>
                Currently, I do not have a career job but am making preparation to have one which is the reason am at
                BYU Idaho seeking qualification. I am still exploring the beauties of BYU-I but I love my apartment, the
                professors, the great teaching facilities and generally the kindness of the staff and students of this
                great institution. I am pursueing a Bachelor's degree.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am going to be needing all the knowledge I can get from Web Foundamentals class. Understanding how the
                web works in both back and front-end is very important in my career path.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Later Day Saints for more than 18 years and I love
                a quotation by Apostle David A Bedner which says 'Knowing that the Gospel is true is the enssence of
                faith, but staying true to the Gospel is the enssence of conversion'. I also love the scripture in Alma
                37:37 which teaches about discussing issues with God.
            </p>
            <p>
                I really want to have a great stay and an excellent performance over here in BYU-Idaho. I want to get to
                meet people and make great connections before returning back to my country or going wherever the Lord
                has prepared for me.
